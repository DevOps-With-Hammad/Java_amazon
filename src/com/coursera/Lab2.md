- Well done! Now you can declare and initialize a String array and an int array to fetch text String and number int variables. Unfortunately, Kyle made a mistake listing out his superheroes, and you need to change the name and introduction date of one of them.

# Step 1:- 
- Change the name of one of the superheroes in the String array.
 # üñ•Ô∏è It‚Äôs time to get coding!

 - TODO 3: Here, you need to change or modify the name of one of the superheroes. To do this, you can use a statement like superheroes[0] = "Black Widow";. Can you guess which element of the array you would change with this statement? That‚Äôs right, the first!

# Instructions:

* Remove the first TODO 3a block and write a statement to print the original name of the superhero at the third position (Remember: Position and index aren‚Äôt the same thing!)

* Remove the second TODO 3b block and write a statement to modify the name of the superhero at the third position to ‚ÄúThor‚Äù.

* Remove the third TODO 3c block and write a statement to print the new modified name of the superhero at the third position.

# Run the code in your IDE.

- Print the original and modified superhero name.

- Compare the output to the expected results

 - Now that you‚Äôve made some changes to Kyle‚Äôs list of superheroes, you‚Äôll probably want to check that you made no errors, like accidentally missing an introduction date or superhero name. To do this, you can write a statement to confirm that the length of the String array and of the int array are the same.

 - Step 1: Check that the String array and the int array contain the same number of elements
# üñ•Ô∏è It‚Äôs time to get coding!

# TODO 5: Here, you must check that the length of the array containing the superheroes' names is the same as the length of the array of their introduction year. To do this, you can use a statement like arrayName.length.

# Tip

- length prints the number of elements in an array.

- For example, If there is an int array named numberOfBuildings, you can use numberOfBuildings.length to find the length of the array.

# Instructions:

* Remove the first TODO 5a block and write a statement to print the length of the array containing the superheroes‚Äô names.

* Remove the second TODO 5b block and write a statement to print the length of the array containing the superhero‚Äôs year of introduction.

 * Run your code in your IDE.

* Print the lengths of each array.

# Compare the output of your program to the expected results.

* TODO 5a: print the length of the array containing superhero names
* TODO 5b: print the length of the array containing superhero year of introduction
